Problem:

You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?


Solution:

class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) {
            return n;
        }

        int first = 1;
        int second = 2;
        int third = 0;

        for (int i=3; i <= n; i++) {
            third = first + second;
            first = second;
            second = third;
        }
        return second;
    }
}
